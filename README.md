# Dissertation - Code word detection by Large language models (ROUS10)
Repository of files for Dissertation.
University of Strathclyde

There are four folders in this repository.

1)BigQuery: Contains code for Dataset preparation using BigQuery and files generated  
2)FastText: Contains code for training and testing FastText classifier along with training and testing files generated  
3)GPT_API: Contains code for performing code word detection experiments with GPT-3 using OpenAI API  
4)HuggingFace: Contains code for performing code word detection experiments with facebook/bart-large-mnli and MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli models using Hugging Face Inference API  
5)VertexAI: Contains code for performing code word detection experiments with PaLM 2 using Vertext AI API  

*	Each of these subfolders has a README.txt file with instructions on how to execute the code  
*	All the results generated are logged in output files and the output files generated as part of oringinal experimentation are placed in the folder "Files",
which is present in each of the above Subfolders.
