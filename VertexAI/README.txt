For working with PaLM 2 model, we need to first enable the Vertex AI API on the Google cloud platform
For this, log into Google cloud dashboard and enable Vertex AI API using the following link: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/aiplatform.googleapis.com

For credentials to call API, I have used the cross application credential feature of google, for this to work, the notebook's have to be run on Google Collab.
When the notebook is run on Google Collab, there will be a prompt to allow authentication, we  need to click on Yes and continue execution of the notebook.
More details can be found in the following link: https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/text-bison?

The folder contains two files:
1) Test_PaLM2.ipynb:
 This notebook will extract each sentence from the dataset "CombinesDS_2.txt" and invoke the API to test the PaLM 2 model.
 In google collab, upload the file "CombinesDS_2.txt" before running the notebook.
 The notebook will produce an output file PaLM_test_result1.txt which contains the results of testing.
 Actual file generated during my experiments are placed in "Files" folder.


2) Evaluate_PaLM2_results.ipynb
This notebook evaluates the results generated by the model and produces one consolidated file which contains actual values and predicted values.
The actual file generated during the experiments is placed in the folder "Files" with file name "Result_file_PaLM1.txt"
For better visualisation, an excel work book version of this file is also placed in the folder "Result_file_PaLM1.xlsx"
The notebook also produces another file "palm2_CW_stat1.csv" which contain the statistics of the code words identified by PaLM 2.

Note: "Files" folder contains actual output files generated during experiments.
