The python notebook uses the dataset file CombinesDS_2.txt.
This notebook has to be run on Google Collab because the library requires certain pre-installed C++ utilities which are preinstalled in Google Collab
The model training is done using file that gets generated during execution of this notebook, i.e., Codeword_Train.txt

Note:
Codeword_Train.txt and Codeword_Test.txt generated during my experiments is placed in the "Files" folder 
It generates a file called "predicted_labels.txt"
