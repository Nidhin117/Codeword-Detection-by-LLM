Also that person with a nice camera probably has a particular style of shooting that is very unlikely to be "whole body shot squarely in the center of the frame" which is apparently what most rando tourists are looking for. 
That's exactly what I do. It's sexy if u have a nice face and what not . and if u have a normal body without excess body hair. 
Am I the only one who sees a lawyer making an advertisement for his profession.  Don't talk to the police, get a lawyer at $200 an hour instead. 
Your shit not flying everywhere, priceless. 
When shopkeepers are angry at you when you conclude the deal, you know you had a *somewhat* good price. (even though you were nice and polite during the ordeal) 
Wonderful.  Care to provide me with a good voice diction app? 
Depends. My dad recently graduated and is pursuing a legal career, he's 52 with 50k in debt. He's not worried about paying back his loans because he made other sacrifices. If you expect to keep your mortgage and nice car then yes it's not smart. 
My drivers license is already in there man, my address is on it 
Holy shit this is terrible advice. 
"Poor rug! Please pet it and apologize nicely." 
And put them in a yonana for ice cream substitute 
Also, do you really wait a minute before eating ice cream? 
Lpt: do the same thing to your ice cream scoop 
Wait, why are we dividing ice cream with guns? 
Can confirm. Have eaten melty ice cream. 
I want ice cream... "I REALLY want ice cream. 
It wasn't wet-wet, just a little damp. I didn't notice it at all, I just thought they were cold because they'd been put under a thing of ice cream (no idea why). 
Ice cream goes right in the fridge for 12 hours minimum. Higher quality ice cream melts better. Cookies and Cream is also highly recommend. 
I put my ice cream directly in the fridge when it gets home from the store. I just drink it with a straw. Yum! 
MY solution is just to be so poor buying anything not on my list would seem like buying a lamborghini.  "SIX DOLLARS? too rich for my blood, keep your ice cream." 
My driver's ed teacher told us to practice steering out of a skid in the desert (I'm in AZ).  One kid tried, and slid his car sideways into a saguaro cactus, which fell, crushed the car, and killed him. 
I see so many people with expensive cameras who have no idea at all. I'm a pro and I carry a small point and shoot or I use my iPhone. I would take this advice with a grain of salt. 
/u/fordiman don't forget the thumb print trick. Make a thumb print in your raw meat before seasoning and it will prevent puffing, creating a better shape and making sure the hot juices won't spray all over you when you bite into it. 
Or just pay for it. Seriously, it's a great service. 
Instead of using evidence of crimes to punish people just make everything a crime so you can punish the people you think deserve it. What a great justice system 
Police don't come right away, they only come after the facts. Like, writing up reports and etc. 
I thought this was Shitty LPT and I was confused at the advice 
It's nice to see you, asshole! 
Hey Fuckface, nice to see you! 
Thank you. That's some great advice. 
It makes the room warmer. (This could be bullshit but it sure feels like it.) In the middle of a freezing winter, the last thing you want is to be walking around on ice cold wood or laminate floors. 
That's exactly how my brain works IRL. I suck at socializing. I was a really shy and quiet kid so I guess I didn't get enough practice growing up. 
Oh I know WHY they can't say it, I'm just saying if they did I would give them a 10 on a customer service survey. 
It is arguably more convenient than torrenting, and reasonable priced. 
This is a sure fire way to get your ass to the police station for further questioning. What do you have to hide, why don't you act like a normal citizen 
Best advice you're going to get here: don't text her. Create an opportunity to talk with her in person. Once you feel comfortable flirting in person, flirty texting will become natural and not awkward. 
Clearly you need to build a fire under it to make it nice and warm. 
Doesn't work for me. If I go on a full stomach I end up with a single frozen pizza and a tub of ice cream because I can't think of anything else that I want to eat. 
If we're good can we go for ice cream, Dad? 
This happens in the English language, just like how "iced cream" turned into "ice cream" and "iced tea" is currently making it's transition to "ice tea". 
I am weird in that I love eating all types off food in the shower. Anything from ice cream to pizza. Try it sometime! 
I like to put a piece of plastic wrap over the ice cream before putting the lid on it. Make sure the plastic wrap is in direct contact with the ice cream. This will prevent the ice cream from getting freezer burn. 
i used ice cream and it worked for the most part! 
The Snap-On truck is like the ice cream truck for mechanics. 
Yeah me too, but I've been doing this for my ice creams...just thought I'd share it with the rest of the reddit community \m/ 
Gluten free option? Indeed! Add soaked chia seeds and / or flax seeds ground up into a powder + your choice of gluten free flour mix (they're all pretty expensive, i just go rice + buckwheat) 
Place a nice, warm, flour tortilla over a plate. Eat your crispy, corn tortillo, tacos over said plate. Whatever falls on the plate roll up in the soft flour tortilla and eat as a burrito. Problem solved! 
Some states salt their roads in the winter to melt ice 
Juices have just as much sugar in them as soda does. If you want fruit juice, eat a fruit. 
This is a small town where the police have never had to deal with any sort of cyber crime. This kid is about to made an example of. 
I guess it depends on what kind of ice you get. I can see it being dangerous with thick solid ice, but I don't think a scraper would be very effective on that kind of ice. We only get thick frost that would melt off before falling. 
If im roadblocked, the nicotne gets the brain juices flowing and the walking gives some variety in stimulus. 
Officers won't jump start your car because of the risk of damage to the squad.  They will happily call you a cab/tow truck, but they're not going to jump start your car with their publicly owned/maintained vehicle. 
In my high school's parking lot, whenever someone needs a jump start they usually ask the SRO, if no other student offers help first. Very cool to see the police officers are happy to jump the cars for free. 
My advice wasn't meant to suggest you'd always walk away from the fight, just gain perspective and calm down. 
Voice, not so much. Appearance, for sure. You can workout, change your hair, get proper-fighting clothes, have good posture, be well groomed, etc...All it takes is a bit of effort. 
Reminds me of a call centre I worked at when I was younger. 80% of the donations for police/fire fighters went to administration and 20% went to the charities themselves. I quit that job two days later after finding that out. 
As an American that has traveled quite a bit, I think you'll find America fascinating. I think you'll find it's the nicest 3rd world country around.

-------- flour------- 
Yes, mix eggs, salt, flour and sugar in bowl. Eat with spoon and enjoy. 
Depends on the usage and both of OP's examples are sentences that would be spoken aloud, in which case *just* and *really* are linguistic flourishes that add emphasis. Hence, they are in fact stronger having the words than without. 
Bugs wind up in food. It happens. Most places are allowed to have a certain number of beetles (certain kinds of beetles) in flour before it's considered unsanitary. 
Avoiding excess sugar. There are lots of people who don't even use tooth paste because of the flouride in it. They just eat healthy so its not so much of a worry 
because you love the little snowflake and you want to boost their self esteem and seem them flourish or some crap like that 
A flour shart 
Pro tip: rather than AP flour use half cake flour half bread flour. Rest n' chill dat doe before bakin' et 
your suggestion is to not let the shoes and socks air out and dry but to keep it damp and moist so bacteria can flourish? 
Fact: Maple syrup and pancakes *can* have nutritional value if eaten in moderation and if you use healthy ingredients e.g. whole wheat flour and real syrup vs. the ones filled with corn syrup and other sugars. 
Mix in a cup of flour... You'll be in heaven soon.

Gluten free option? Indeed! Add soaked chia seeds and / or flax seeds ground up into a powder + your choice of gluten free flour mix (they're all pretty expensive, i just go rice + buckwheat) 
Baby powder works better,  plus its cheaper usually, than rolls of paper towels. But don't use flour. You'll be making biscuits in there by lunchtime.. 
Self rising flour has baking soda mixed in already.  Why not make it a **one** ingredient pizza crust and use pre-made pizza crust? 
Corn tortillas are a little too bland in my own opinion. Here in Mexico they sell a blend of corn flour that is called "maseca", that is much softer, and overall easier to munch. 
American here, I like to layer my tacos, white flour tortilla, cheese, hard shell, filings. 
Sand comes in different sizes from really small pebbles to as fine as flour. This tip depends on where you live. 
&gt; If you can’t find self-rising flour, you can substitute 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 1 ½ tsp. baking powder, and ¾ tsp. of salt. 
LPT part II:  if you don't have self rising flour, general purpose flour with a pinch of baking powder (not baking soda) is a perfectly acceptable substitute 
Place a nice, warm, flour tortilla over a plate. Eat your crispy, corn tortillo, tacos over said plate. Whatever falls on the plate roll up in the soft flour tortilla and eat as a burrito. Problem solved!

A minature succulent or cactus. Nothing else. 
&gt; cactus-cocked demons 
That's true. My uncle once caught a falling cactus. Pure reflex. Quick and dirty. Sometimes out brain does not have enough time to evaluate a situation and thus just triggers the behavior that most (but not all) of the time is beneficial.

I think about elephants 
To prevent horse's dick as a wallpaper always have picture of  elephant dick in a male's ass as a wallpaper. It'll at least confuse intruders. 
Don't trust Barb. The amount coke I've seen that lady snort off of genitals could kill an elephant. 
With ants it's a matter of terminal velocity. Which is a combination of body weight, shape, and size; an ant that weighed as much as an elephant would be significantly larger than the elephant. 
I heard picturing black elephant. 
Aren't thing with lesser body weight more likely to go undamaged after a fall? It's why an elephant would break its knees after a short fall but an ant can walk away from most anything. 
You should all send flowers to my mom. I was 12 lbs and short, she recently described it to my pregnant sister as "giving birth to a fucking elephant" (direct quote) sorry mom

I want my money to help the nerd who couldn't make an elephant lamp in shop!

It's okay, his recipe was too salty anyway. 
Actually salt and vinegar chips don't really have "vinegar" like you'd think of it, rather they have the salt sodium diacetate. Acetic acid = vinegar 
Sodium conveys the salt flavor, and the acetate gives you the vinegar flavor! 
I'm in the habit of keeping an unwrapped block of salted butter in my front pocket. Would-be thieves will be shocked to find my warm pudge - it also serves as a tasty treat or emergency food supply in winter months. 
Taking a shot of apple cider vinegar (or dilute a small amount in a glass of cold water) or eating some salt and vinegar chips also helps a ton! 
Season salt on curly fries is where it's at.  Something to go with that burger of yours. 
I always take these offers with a grain of salt.  It's like the old AAMCO transmission jingle that went "not everyone who drives in here needs a new transmission, but you're going to get one anyway". 
I see so many people with expensive cameras who have no idea at all. I'm a pro and I carry a small point and shoot or I use my iPhone. I would take this advice with a grain of salt. 
Look at the experiments they've done, you'd be surprised.  http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/12/the-burger-lab-salting-ground-beef.html 
You don't get to pick whether you get a salty veteran or a 1 week scrub. I've been poked multi times before and I'm not fat or old. 
&gt; If you can’t find self-rising flour, you can substitute 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 1 ½ tsp. baking powder, and ¾ tsp. of salt. 
Buy a fuck load of rock salt before winter, part at the top of the hill and walk your ass, and invest in a come-along winch. 
OK but some people believe that putting salt in water makes it boil significantly hotter 
Salt doesn't work at low temperatures, below 20F the salt is serving roughly the same purpose as sand or kitty litter, being just rough enough to get you moving 
The last time this was asked, a surgeon responded with salt (saline solution).  Sure enough it worked better for me than hydrogen peroxide without any scrubbing even!  The surgeon explained the science behind it. 
I'd take that with a bit of salt, I've seen both used a lot with yours being for something short and the other guys one for something longer. 
You sound salty bro. I don't like the Rav4 either, but I'm not the one driving it and neither are you, so why give a shit? 
Some states salt their roads in the winter to melt ice 
Wood ashes fromm a woodstove or even a fire pit work instantly.  Less messy in the spring than cat litter, and won't kill grass like salt can.  Very lightweight, too. 
just be prepared for a few paint chips from the larger chunks of salt. 
This is rather less than healthy if done to excess, but ingesting salt will help your body retain more moisture, so your mucus glands will produce less runny mucus.

Works just as well with grown-ups in my experience. "I need x" vs. "You're great at x, can you help me with this x?" 
/u/fordiman don't forget the thumb print trick. Make a thumb print in your raw meat before seasoning and it will prevent puffing, creating a better shape and making sure the hot juices won't spray all over you when you bite into it. 
Yeah....but it's such a tiny amount that it's virtually harmless, you'd have to eat something like a entire handful of seeds to do any sort of damage. 
Don't forget the fire extinguisher. My backseat has turned into a vehicle repair and recovery toolbox. 
Same feeling the other day.  Now I just want to eat beans every morning.

Ask yourself if you would eat another apple 
A great big bushy beard of asshair! 
Or just pay for it. Seriously, it's a great service. 
It's a roller coaster of emotions the first two months IMO. That takes its toll on you. That was the sucky part, the constant fear and worries. Just having a new born who is fully dependent on you. Plus ours was not a great sleeper haha 
Additionally they can take an active role in supporting you in the decision. Such as exercising with you or suggesting a more healthful restaurant when going to eat. Or suggesting maybe you not have another drink. 
Instead of using evidence of crimes to punish people just make everything a crime so you can punish the people you think deserve it. What a great justice system 
Sounds like a great approach to a potentially dangerous activity. Hence Darwin awards. 
Thank you. That's some great advice. 
Best advice you're going to get here: don't text her. Create an opportunity to talk with her in person. Once you feel comfortable flirting in person, flirty texting will become natural and not awkward. 
I just eat the freezer burn. Ice cream parmesan. 
Doesn't work for me. If I go on a full stomach I end up with a single frozen pizza and a tub of ice cream because I can't think of anything else that I want to eat.

Noooooo, I'm currently eating mine and didn't bother to ask! 
works great for xmas cards too 
The rule at my house is that you eat whatever I make or you don't eat at all. 
Best way to do it is to first save as much as you can. As in cut expenses that are non essentials like cable. Try to increase your salary the next step. Create a budget so that you have a plan. 
This could apply to me as a 19 y/o lol. Youngest of all my siblings and have a literal dozen of nephews/nieces. And sadly have had quite a few family deaths as of late. 
The only reason I do cardio before my workout in the morning is to make my head sweat so that my hair gets less crazy. 
Anyways, not everyone eats granola bars because they think they are being healthy. 
Do you happen to be a woman? Not to scare you, but I have been reading about how [doctors take women less seriously](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/emergency-room-wait-times-sexism/410515/). I hope new doctor is better. 
I believe he is referring to using a car battery and cables to shock someone. With the casino bit probably a cheat/thief, can't think of the movie he might be referring to though. 
Maybe he beats her or is emotionally abusive and she just works really hard putting up a good front because that's how he handles things and she lives in terror under his rule now. 
get TheraBreathe mouthwash/toothepaste. 
For my last party of 8-10 guests i bumped the temperature range down a few degrees. 2 hours in an the AC kicked on. Turns out 10 people drinking and taking about scotch heats my small house very well. Turned my heat pump off and opened a window. 
Juices have just as much sugar in them as soda does. If you want fruit juice, eat a fruit. 
If your tap water is ever that hot you ought to turn down the setting on the water heater. You're wasting energy and creating a dangerous situation. 
Thus forcing them to perform a dangerous and illegal maneuver to get around a road hazard that threatens their safety. 
You should use your own name but if you feel the need, go ahead and pretend to be the great dangerzone2 :) 
You could see a doctor? I had a friend when I was in school that always had REALLY sweaty hands! He went to see a doctor and had injections that would stop his hands sweating so much, could be worth looking into! 
TIL people named monsterbreath are faggots that jump to conclusions based off of nearly nothing. 
Good idea. You never know when you'll need to beat someone. 
Try eating in bed. After each meal, slip the remains like a greasy baguette down the gap between the bed and the wall. It makes a hilarious noise, attracts neat pets and if you put it under the mattress it makes a softer sleep-space! 
How soon after you eat do you go to sleep? 
Are you eating curry in the evening? 
People who travel eat at a lot of different restaurants.  How about "Are there any restaurants you would recommend in destination-town?" 
I have an empty coffee can to collect the grounds for compost/garden use. I keep a small ladle around to beat the bottom of it, the coffee spills out no problem. 
Or you can listen one or two dream theater songs. 
Thank you. That's some great advice. 
Best advice you're going to get here: don't text her. Create an opportunity to talk with her in person. Once you feel comfortable flirting in person, flirty texting will become natural and not awkward. 
I just eat the freezer burn. Ice cream parmesan. 
Doesn't work for me. If I go on a full stomach I end up with a single frozen pizza and a tub of ice cream because I can't think of anything else that I want to eat. 
I am weird in that I love eating all types off food in the shower. Anything from ice cream to pizza. Try it sometime! 
Gluten free option? Indeed! Add soaked chia seeds and / or flax seeds ground up into a powder + your choice of gluten free flour mix (they're all pretty expensive, i just go rice + buckwheat) 
Place a nice, warm, flour tortilla over a plate. Eat your crispy, corn tortillo, tacos over said plate. Whatever falls on the plate roll up in the soft flour tortilla and eat as a burrito. Problem solved! 
Noooooo, I'm currently eating mine and didn't bother to ask! 
works great for xmas cards too 
The rule at my house is that you eat whatever I make or you don't eat at all. 
Best way to do it is to first save as much as you can. As in cut expenses that are non essentials like cable. Try to increase your salary the next step. Create a budget so that you have a plan. 
This could apply to me as a 19 y/o lol. Youngest of all my siblings and have a literal dozen of nephews/nieces. And sadly have had quite a few family deaths as of late. 
The only reason I do cardio before my workout in the morning is to make my head sweat so that my hair gets less crazy. 
Anyways, not everyone eats granola bars because they think they are being healthy. 
Do you happen to be a woman? Not to scare you, but I have been reading about how [doctors take women less seriously](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/emergency-room-wait-times-sexism/410515/). I hope new doctor is better. 
I believe he is referring to using a car battery and cables to shock someone. With the casino bit probably a cheat/thief, can't think of the movie he might be referring to though. 
Maybe he beats her or is emotionally abusive and she just works really hard putting up a good front because that's how he handles things and she lives in terror under his rule now. 
get TheraBreathe mouthwash/toothepaste. 
For my last party of 8-10 guests i bumped the temperature range down a few degrees. 2 hours in an the AC kicked on. Turns out 10 people drinking and taking about scotch heats my small house very well. Turned my heat pump off and opened a window. 
Juices have just as much sugar in them as soda does. If you want fruit juice, eat a fruit. 
If your tap water is ever that hot you ought to turn down the setting on the water heater. You're wasting energy and creating a dangerous situation. 
Thus forcing them to perform a dangerous and illegal maneuver to get around a road hazard that threatens their safety.

-------- drink------- 
I put my ice cream directly in the fridge when it gets home from the store. I just drink it with a straw. Yum! 
I don't drink now. 
To each their own. I've converted multiple people to beer drinkers this way. Just having them take sips of varieties of beers until they found one they liked. Then they can figure out what they like about it and expand themselves. 
Quit drinking alcohol. 
Driving the morning after drinking isn't drunk driving by any means though. And people drive impaired all the damn time, it's just that driving exhausted or distracted is a lot more socially acceptable than driving slightly over the alcohol limit. 
I can drink to that! 
Additionally they can take an active role in supporting you in the decision. Such as exercising with you or suggesting a more healthful restaurant when going to eat. Or suggesting maybe you not have another drink. 
A target employee this young teenage girl told me they get a free Starbucks drink for every person they get to sign up for there dumb ass red card. 
Should have been there to stare it while drinking her beer. 
Depending on your state it is perfectly legal for minors to drink in the house with their parents. This might help some parents with the topic if legality is the only concern. 
Waaaay ahead of ya.  Only a fool would go outside with the intent of smoking many cigarettes in a row without some kind of drink.  What I'd love is to be content just to read. 
drink lots of water. 
i would think that the extra calories and stimulants in an energy drink would keep you awake? isn't that the whole point of 4LOKO and Vodka&amp;RedBull? 
Yeah, I actually think I misunderstood the reason for this LPT. I thought it was something to do with holding really hot coffee lol. I suppose this works if it's because it's too hot to drink. 
For my last party of 8-10 guests i bumped the temperature range down a few degrees. 2 hours in an the AC kicked on. Turns out 10 people drinking and taking about scotch heats my small house very well. Turned my heat pump off and opened a window. 
I don't have a bad reaction but I have a thing about not drinking my calories... I have lost a fair bit of weight by giving up regular soda. 
*drink 
&gt;And their hot dog + drink combo is seemingly immune to inflation. 
My SO did this with £60 on new years. Got it back last weekend when he wasn't expecting it back and it paid for our drinks and such. 
Just make an effort to occasionally replace a soda drink with a water or other drink.  It gets easier the more you do it. 
Unfortunately my dog takes a drink and then walks away, dripping water like crazy as she goes, making a water trail. 
Get a trade/skills, take a contract to work in remote mine/station/location doing said trade/skills, invest and save every dollar for three-five years. Have no friends, don't drink, don't smoke, don't get sick, work all the time. 
Do you drink coffee? 
If you're going to drink k-cup coffee you might as well take caffeine pills cause you sure as hell don't like coffee.

-------- crime------- 
Instead of using evidence of crimes to punish people just make everything a crime so you can punish the people you think deserve it. What a great justice system 
Normally I wouldn't care, but any crime committed on an airplane is automatically a felony or some other such absurdly severe thing that makes this *super* not worth it. 
Serious question: what's your view on the rebuttal that the scam/crime culture is the result of discrimination toward Romani, causing them to turn to unlawful ways of making a living? 
No. There is obviously a problem. But you need to be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was committing the crime. 
You do it every day you are in public.  In fact, you probably pass people in poverty and who commit crimes, sit next to them, visit stores and restaurants and gas stations where they are likely to strike. 
I'm talking about being interrogated for serious crimes. I'm honest with traffic stops too. 
&gt; And saying because there is less violent crime it means Europeans are less likely to help someone is need is the most asinine thing I've ever heard. 
Very little *major* things? Are you a crime person? 
That said, if you fall asleep outside their house with a gun in the car, you will probably be charged with conspiracy or some other crime to do with having intent to kill someone. 
What if I am reporting a crime?  Does this still apply? 
There's a [presumptive test for blood](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/bca/bca-divisions/forensic-science/Pages/forensic-programs-crime-scene-phenol.aspx) using phenolphthalein. If you want to be sure, you'd get into doing proper analysis in a lab. 
This is a small town where the police have never had to deal with any sort of cyber crime. This kid is about to made an example of. 
LPT: Stay out of high crime areas. 
It's all perspective. I'm from a very sheltered middle european country and I find american crime rates damn scary. 
Coming from a country with a lot of crime, I really can't stress this enough. 
Why would she laugh? "Haha you should have committed a crime, idiot!" Good on you man! Wish more people would do those things. 
In the UK it is an actual crime to not offer someone a cup of tea if they enter your house. Even burglars. 
I'm saying it would be better to compare city by city statistics to get a more realistic expectation of the crime rate of a place you are moving to (as per OPs post)

-------- danger------- 
Jack already up, tire off, flashlight falls, then what. Make the safest situation out of a dangerous one. 
It might be more dangerous to the individual driving/walking drunk but it's not the people driving drunk that generally gets seriously injured or killed. It's the people the drunk driver hits that suffer. 
"Because it's dangerous". There, an actual answer. And the LPT is obviously more about stuff like 
That is seriously irresponsible owners. Not only is it a nuisance, it's dangerous for the animal. Dog vs Car = car wins 
&gt; would be the first person to call them when your life or the life of someone you love is in danger? 
More dangerous (for the individual) to walk drunk than to drive. Just. Stay. Home. If. You. Have. Been. Drinking. 
Sounds like a great approach to a potentially dangerous activity. Hence Darwin awards. 
Specifically pt does not release significant amounts of nasty chemicals through combustion into the air. One of the reasons it's made how it is. Wouldn't want a house fire to endanger the rest of the towns air. 
This cannot be said enough. Defend the honor of your spouse (with exceptions of course if your safety or sanity are in danger). Leave the bitching for your therapist. 
Living dangerously. 
You're right...it's a general attitude problem in the US...you guys are idiots, and endangering people around you. 
If your tap water is ever that hot you ought to turn down the setting on the water heater. You're wasting energy and creating a dangerous situation. 
Thus forcing them to perform a dangerous and illegal maneuver to get around a road hazard that threatens their safety. 
Congrats, you just made that stretch of road 10x more dangerous for everyone 
I guess it depends on what kind of ice you get. I can see it being dangerous with thick solid ice, but I don't think a scraper would be very effective on that kind of ice. We only get thick frost that would melt off before falling. 
You should use your own name but if you feel the need, go ahead and pretend to be the great dangerzone2 :) 
They don't carry the same diseases we do. Same reason cannibalism is dangerous 
You slow down then speed up again. That was my thought, just realised you mean to the same speed as before. But still, not sure it's smart to piss off more someone who might put your life in danger. 
This seems...dangerous. 
Ice will still fall off at highway speeds and is even more dangerous than snow 
You clearly have a bad time with civil discussion as you make comments on my intelligence... Slowing down gradually doesn't pose much danger. The worst that will happen is a minor fender bender which would be the fault of the tailgater.

-------- smoking------- 
Waaaay ahead of ya.  Only a fool would go outside with the intent of smoking many cigarettes in a row without some kind of drink.  What I'd love is to be content just to read. 
I agree with your disagreement.  Worked a second job and found myself smoking more because of the added stress. 
I'm in Canada right now is - 40F I'm outside smoking in a hoodie and jeans 
Maybe even better, get a job that requires regular blood tests. That way, it's either you smoke and lose your job, or stop smoking (: 
Im working hardest when im smoking and pacing. 
Rolling down the street smoking Indo? 
I knew a guy who was smoking a cigar while driving, the cherry flew off, went down his throat, and he had to get a tracheotomy. I don't smoke anymore. 
&gt;It's kind of *pathetic* but I started smoking for this reason. 
I don't understand how people are willing to discard friendships for weed...it's not cocaine or heroin, it's fucking pot. There's more wrong than a bud smoking habit if you're willing to steal for weed. 
take up smoking weed, you'll stop giving a fuck about any of it and there will be plenty of others like you to enjoy it with 
Still smoking, never had cancer.

-------- inject------- 
Good enough for me to make a hacky solution involving DLL injection at least. 
Phenobarbital is cheaper as an injectable but Keppra is dirt cheap as a tablet. 
You could just decompile it, inject some code, then recompile. 
Are you injecting anabolic steroids? 
So changing a DLL could mean someone else has injected some malicious code along side the regular functionality 
No clue, but if it were me I would probably inject a wood glue or epoxy into the bubble and then clamp it down or stack some weight on top until dry. 
Drill a small hole in from below to inject your epoxy or other adhesive. Put a wrap of tape around the bit so you don't go too far. 
One idea...put some 5 minute epoxy in a syringe, inject it into the bubble, push down a few time to smear around, and then place books and heavy weights on top of the bubble. Leave for an hour and then remove 
You could see a doctor? I had a friend when I was in school that always had REALLY sweaty hands! He went to see a doctor and had injections that would stop his hands sweating so much, could be worth looking into!

This is kind  of a LPT for smokers, if you don't smoke thats a good thing but you obviously don't smoke. 
just cuz i smoke doesnt mean im all peace n love bullshit. dont try to put labels on me Dad!!!

wanna smoke a bowl? 
LPT: don't smoke. If you need nicotine, vape ��

-------- take------- 
I always take these offers with a grain of salt.  It's like the old AAMCO transmission jingle that went "not everyone who drives in here needs a new transmission, but you're going to get one anyway". 
I see so many people with expensive cameras who have no idea at all. I'm a pro and I carry a small point and shoot or I use my iPhone. I would take this advice with a grain of salt. 
It's a roller coaster of emotions the first two months IMO. That takes its toll on you. That was the sucky part, the constant fear and worries. Just having a new born who is fully dependent on you. Plus ours was not a great sleeper haha

Probably because they think a regular looking car with a sign announcing "Uber" might be a serial killer posing as a for-hire driver. It takes a lot more work to fake a taxi cab. 
In my experience, most taxi companies won't take reservations in advance.  They will tell you to call back when you're ready to be picked up. 
It doesnt work like that, Ladainian "Prince" Tomlinson. You cant just take ownership of a comment like that 
The person who took his call may have been new or lazy but I used to work for them. You need the serial number and the person that didn't take it could be fired for it. 
A doggie bag is commonly the leftovers you take home from a restaurant. 
Too reliable to be profitable? I would take a Ranger over an F150 any day for what I need a truck for. 
Well, at least you learned from your mistake. You're not Jay from the Inbetweener's now, and that's a good thing. 
Well take it from a guy that is in his fifties married to a woman that has gone through the menopause, Bollox! 
I like the "don't take yourself so seriously, nobody else does." 
I read it as pay off the car. Not just make the payment. My mistake! 
Voice, not so much. Appearance, for sure. You can workout, change your hair, get proper-fighting clothes, have good posture, be well groomed, etc...All it takes is a bit of effort. 
But what if your mind just keeps wandering? I always have this inner dialogue with myself that goes on and on to the point I give up and take sleeping pills. 
If you're going to drink k-cup coffee you might as well take caffeine pills cause you sure as hell don't like coffee. 
Or just buy regular milk and some lactase pills (i.e. lactaid) to take with it. 
Apparently OP forgot to take her pills today. 
I vacuum my area rug. And a dry cleaners will take care of any spills that may occur. 
This also helps with medicine you might forget to take in the mornings

-------- jump------- 
Yeah, they're not stopping to give anyone a jump. 
One of my favorite pro tips. You can get around the "uber and lyft don't pick up at airports" by jumping on the next passing rental car shuttle and then calling an uber to their lot. Done it at LAX a bunch. 
I don't understand the question. Someone else posted a link to AAA benefits, which include free towing up to a certain mileage per tow, battery jumping, tire changing, and a few other things. You can also get discounts on a lot lot of things. 
Officers won't jump start your car because of the risk of damage to the squad.  They will happily call you a cab/tow truck, but they're not going to jump start your car with their publicly owned/maintained vehicle. 
TIL people named monsterbreath are faggots that jump to conclusions based off of nearly nothing. 
&gt;jumper cables 
I had an awesome jump box that also had built in flood light and hazard lights. It was pretty awesome, I should get a new one. 
But you don't want (or need) to turn the donor car off, that is a good way to end up with 2 cars needing a jump instead of just 1. 
In my high school's parking lot, whenever someone needs a jump start they usually ask the SRO, if no other student offers help first. Very cool to see the police officers are happy to jump the cars for free. 
Okay, this can be solved by calling the cab company and asking if they do jump-starts. Not a big deal, or something worth going on a rant about. 
By that logic, I'll try to jump off a cliff next time I'm near one, because I daydream about flying. 
Yeah, they're not stopping to give anyone a jump. 
One of my favorite pro tips. You can get around the "uber and lyft don't pick up at airports" by jumping on the next passing rental car shuttle and then calling an uber to their lot. Done it at LAX a bunch. 
I don't understand the question. Someone else posted a link to AAA benefits, which include free towing up to a certain mileage per tow, battery jumping, tire changing, and a few other things. You can also get discounts on a lot lot of things. 
Officers won't jump start your car because of the risk of damage to the squad.  They will happily call you a cab/tow truck, but they're not going to jump start your car with their publicly owned/maintained vehicle. 
TIL people named monsterbreath are faggots that jump to conclusions based off of nearly nothing.

-------- sleep------- 
It's a roller coaster of emotions the first two months IMO. That takes its toll on you. That was the sucky part, the constant fear and worries. Just having a new born who is fully dependent on you. Plus ours was not a great sleeper haha 
Honestly, **reduce stress,** make sure you're getting **enough sleep** (**9+ hours,** not only 8), exercise (1-2 hours of *vigorous* exercise a day), **water,** nutrition, and healthy fats/oils. 
That said, if you fall asleep outside their house with a gun in the car, you will probably be charged with conspiracy or some other crime to do with having intent to kill someone. 
If you sleep really deep I can see how you'd need a trick to wake up. But in this case, my response has always been 'show some discipline and get your ass out of bed. You're an adult with responsibilities, act like it." 
Took me 3 nights of our Daughter being home before it was blow-up mattress in the study/tiny room. Literally only thing we fit in the room is a desk and the mattress. I suffer migraines and lack of sleep is a major trigger. 
Your going into sleep paralysis 
I think their point was that once you stop stressing about the importance of falling asleep, you're more likely to just fall asleep. 
Heads up, I sleep naked, just in case you wake up before me.. ;) 
Whatever helps you sleep at night, creep. 
Try eating in bed. After each meal, slip the remains like a greasy baguette down the gap between the bed and the wall. It makes a hilarious noise, attracts neat pets and if you put it under the mattress it makes a softer sleep-space! 
How soon after you eat do you go to sleep? 
Literally the last thing I do before I sleep is Shit, Shave and Shower. 
Doesn't work for me: I get out of bed, turn the damn thing off, go back to bed and fall asleep again. 
But what if your mind just keeps wandering? I always have this inner dialogue with myself that goes on and on to the point I give up and take sleeping pills.

-------- fight------- 
How else are you supposed to win a knife fight against a stronger, faster opponent? 
My advice wasn't meant to suggest you'd always walk away from the fight, just gain perspective and calm down. 
Voice, not so much. Appearance, for sure. You can workout, change your hair, get proper-fighting clothes, have good posture, be well groomed, etc...All it takes is a bit of effort. 
Am not firefighter and I also agree. 
Lol. They then turn around and keep fighting 
LPT: Lend money to anybody you can fight with a 5% weekly interest, proceed to break legs and kill family members until the debt is paid. 
Reminds me of a call centre I worked at when I was younger. 80% of the donations for police/fire fighters went to administration and 20% went to the charities themselves. I quit that job two days later after finding that out. 
I'd recommend not fighting rudeness with rudeness, as it often leads to people putting up barriers, as was the case with your example. Being polite and civil isn't a zero sum game. 
I'm going to have to ask my dad about this one. He's been a firefighter basically his whole adult life, in a couple different departments. Currently a lieutenant in a large city. 
You didn't hear him? His dad is currently a firefighter lieutenant with a lifetime of experience.

-------- travel------- 
As an American that has traveled quite a bit, I think you'll find America fascinating. I think you'll find it's the nicest 3rd world country around. 
Does that involve a lot of travel? 
[This source says 47 days](https://www.cheapair.com/blog/travel-tips/when-to-buy-airline-tickets-based-on-1-5-billion-airfares/) 
Or travel in Europe where you can keep your shoes on. 
People who travel eat at a lot of different restaurants.  How about "Are there any restaurants you would recommend in destination-town?" 
As someone who has traveled to 38 countries. This is not true. 
Yup. I travel a lot and it's the easiest way to keep in touch. 
"In order to maintain company standards, we require time travelers to apply for our senior positions." 
I think most Lost and Founds have a policy about the length of time - but maybe I am wrong. With so many travelers in and out (due to the location of said hotel), I'm sure they figured no one was coming back for it. 
Ah yes, make sure to be late and disorganized when traveling by plane.

-------- pills------- 
I have an empty coffee can to collect the grounds for compost/garden use. I keep a small ladle around to beat the bottom of it, the coffee spills out no problem. 
And not to forget the mental health. I used to work for Walmart. It got so bad that I had to go on anti-anxiety pills. 
But what if your mind just keeps wandering? I always have this inner dialogue with myself that goes on and on to the point I give up and take sleeping pills. 
If you're going to drink k-cup coffee you might as well take caffeine pills cause you sure as hell don't like coffee. 
Or just buy regular milk and some lactase pills (i.e. lactaid) to take with it. 
A multivitamin and several supplements. Some fiber pills on day 1 and 2. This last round I made a big pot of butternut squash soup for family, so I ate the apple skins instead of taking the fiber pills. 
&gt; I had to go on anti-anxiety pills. 
Does that manly power tool address spills? 
Apparently OP forgot to take her pills today. 
I vacuum my area rug. And a dry cleaners will take care of any spills that may occur.

-------- dream------- 
What if it's your hopes and dreams? 
98 Camry ftw. I bought one for $1500 at 222k miles and literally the only issues are cruise doesn't work and the vents knob doesn't work. Dealer serviced since day one and rides like a dream 
That last one is a dream. 
If you don't care about personality of people with whom you have sex in your daydreams, then it seems for me that you just train yourself to have unprotected sex with any person, not just Jennifer Anniston and Jennifer Lawrence. 
By that logic, I'll try to jump off a cliff next time I'm near one, because I daydream about flying. 
If its a jar run hot water only over the lid for a few seconds, this will cause it to expand slightly and will open like a dream. 
I'm daydreaming about calling this a shitty LPT ... Oh man, OP is onto something. 
No, that's fucking stupid.  People know the difference between reality and day dreams. 
Or you can listen one or two dream theater songs. 
How is this not common sense? Do I underestimate the general population's IQ? Perhaps I just set a high bar...just to have that dream crushed.

-------- medicine------- 
"Mould may contain valuable penicillin, reducing your dependency on store-bought medicines. Keep all scraps just in case." 
I did the bathroom/medicine cabinet basics for a friend's baby shower present. The other guests gave me side eye, but the mama-to-be was so pumped about it. It's not as fun to shop for, but definitely so much more useful! 
Not in Canada bro... It's one of the few things that we don't get taxed on to pay for our socialized medicine nimbly bimbly 
This also helps with medicine you might forget to take in the mornings 
1. Practicing medicine: this does not concern medicine 
Thanks for the downvotes, but LPT Rule #5 is No LPTs for medical advice including: practicing medicine, eye/vision, skincare, dental advice, mental health. 
Most jobs aren't like that unless you work in a highly specialised fields like medicine or really high level engineering. 
Physician with sports medicine training here. This explanation about almost everything being a disc injury is incorrect. 
alternative what? you said no medicine and no supplements. adderall doesn't grow in strawberries
